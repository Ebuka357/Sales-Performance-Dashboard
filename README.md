## Recommendations
Actionable steps NovaRetail can take based on the findings:
1. Replicate the September playbook: Perform a retroactive campaign analysis for September
(promotions, stock levels, channel mix) and replicate successful tactics.
2. Invest in Lagos & Abuja market penetration: Lagos drives ~31.5% of revenue — prioritize
marketing and inventory for Lagos. Abuja shows strong accessories volume — push targeted
accessories promotions there.
3. Focus on retention programs: Returning customers deliver ~59% of revenue — build loyalty
programs, repeat-purchase incentives, and targeted offers to increase lifetime value.
4. Leverage top sales reps: Study Abdul Salim’s approach (accounts, leads, pricing, negotiation)
and replicate best practices (mentorship, commission structure). Consider targeted incentives to
lift mid-tier reps.
5. Optimize discount strategy: Average discount per transaction (₦3,248) and total discount
(₦357,300) are reasonable — monitor margin impact during promo months; use targeted
coupons rather than blanket discounts.
6. Prioritize high-margin inventory: Since electronics yield high revenue per unit, ensure
consistent stock, warranty/upsell bundles, and premium service offerings.
7. Encourage repeat purchases among one-time buyers: Convert single-purchase customers
(~70% of customers) with follow-up offers, cross-sell emails, and small loyalty rewards.
8. Investigate Port Harcourt impact: Since excluding Port Harcourt changes total revenue
materially, review operations/returns/late deliveries in that city and optimize logistics or
marketing spend accordingly.
